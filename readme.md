# labyrinthe
Projet Python propos√© par le professeur de maths / Python project proposed by the maths teacher

To launch the game, type in a console 
python3 test.py


1) At the start of Labyrinthe, you muist provide an xml file with game levels.
You can use "levels/default_levels.xml" file, that holds 2 levels

2) Once levels are loaded, the first level appears and the game starts.

Starting from a green zone, you have to tread through yellow, without ever touching red, to reach the blue zone

The action starts with a left click on the green zone and ends : 
- with failure if the mouse touches red. Then the action restarts on the same level.
- with success if you manage to left-click on the blue zone. Then you either go to the next level, if there is one, or you finish the game.
